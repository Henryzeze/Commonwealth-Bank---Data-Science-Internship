# Commonwealth-Bank---Data-Science-Internship

![](cover.jpg)

## Overview

As a Data Analyst for Commonwealth Bank, 1 embarked on a long-term vision alongside one of their trusted partner, InsightSpark, a data science specialist. In this project, we set out to leverage the vast volumes of CBA's transactional data, open-source data, and advanced data science capabilities. Our goal was to construct a platform designed to provide invaluable insights for businesses, governments, and investors across Australia.

In this ambitious endeavor, i and the data engineering team shoulders a significant responsibility. Tasked with constructing data engineering pipelines, conducting analysis on extensive datasets, and deploying algorithms at scale, the success of the project hinged greatly on our collective efforts.

## Task 1

I was given a data set named “supermarket_transactions.csv.” This data set contained three years of transactional data collected from supermarkets across Australia. 

InsightSpark wanted to access the company's data to perform some analysis across Australian supermarkets. But Before this could happen, I needed to perform some analysis on the provided CSV data set (a sample of the database) to answer the following questions:

Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?
How much total cash was spent on these apples?
Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?

My analysis was conducted in Microsoft Excel and the below feedback was gotten.
